Student Grade Calculator Using Python and Streamlit
In this project, I created a simple yet effective tool for calculating student grades based on their midterm, final, and attendance scores. The application is built using Python and Streamlit, making it highly interactive and user-friendly.

Project Overview
The Student Grade Calculator is designed to allow users to input the scores for midterms, finals, and attendance, as well as the respective weights of these components. The program then calculates the total score and assigns a letter grade based on the total score.

Key Features
Interactive Sliders for Input: The application uses Streamlit's slider widget to allow users to easily input scores and weights. The sliders are customizable, with values ranging from 0 to 100, making it straightforward to adjust inputs as needed.

Grade Calculation Logic: The core of the program is the calculate_grade function. This function takes in the scores and weights, calculates the total score, and determines the final grade using a standard grading scale:

A: 90 and above
B: 80 to 89
C: 70 to 79
D: 60 to 69
F: Below 60
Real-time Feedback: As users adjust the sliders, the total score and corresponding grade are updated in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

The application will open in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the grade calculator.

Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Python and Streamlit in building simple yet powerful applications. The Student Grade Calculator is an excellent tool for both students and educators to quickly assess academic performance.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this tool as needed. Contributions are welcome!
